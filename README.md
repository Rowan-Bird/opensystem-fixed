# opensystem-fixed
A fixed version of opensystem originally by Ocawesome101

I fixed Ocawesome101's opensystem for minecraft opencomputers, here's a rundown of what i did

Removed the dependancy of notify.lua, changed the background from 0x00240 (Dark blue) to 0x80000 (Dark red) for style, if i make more changes, they will be listed here

Changed background back to blue due to graphical bugs, and it looks better on tier two screen to use blue
